# coolingTower
The repository calculates the thermodynamic proparties and flowrates of a given packed cooling tower. The set of governing equations are Ordinary Differential Equations which are solved with the fourth order Runge-Kutta numverical method. The repository has 3 main scripts. The first script initialized calculates the Merkel number from a set of experimental data, while the second script calculates the flow-rates and thermodynamic properties of a given cooling tower. The third script is for gathering the required weather data (Wet bulb temperature, humidity, etc) so that the Number of Theoretical Units (NTU number) at a given time period could be calculated.
